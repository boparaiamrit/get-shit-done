<purpose>
Validate built features through conversational testing with persistent state. Creates UAT.md that tracks test progress, survives /clear, and feeds gaps into /gsd:plan-phase --gaps.

User tests all items from a batch checklist, reports results in one response. Claude records.
</purpose>

<philosophy>
**Present ALL tests as a batch checklist. User tests everything, then reports which ones fail in one response.**

Claude presents what SHOULD happen for every test at once. User tests all items, then replies with results.
- "all pass" / "all good" → everything passes
- Numbers with failure descriptions → logged as issues, severity inferred
- Everything not explicitly marked as fail → assumed pass

No Pass/Fail buttons. No severity questions. Just: "Here's everything to test. Tell me what fails."
</philosophy>

If $ARGUMENTS contains a phase number, load context:

```bash
INIT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init verify-work "${PHASE_ARG}")
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi

Parse JSON for: `planner_model`, `checker_model`, `commit_docs`, `phase_found`, `phase_dir`, `phase_number`, `phase_name`, `has_verification`.
</step>

<step name="check_active_session">
**First: Check for active UAT sessions**

```bash
find .planning/phases -name "*-UAT.md" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**If active sessions exist AND no $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Read each file's frontmatter (status, phase) and Current Test section.

Display inline:

```
## Active UAT Sessions

| # | Phase | Status | Current Test | Progress |
|---|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | 04-comments | testing | 3. Reply to Comment | 2/6 |
| 2 | 05-auth | testing | 1. Login Form | 0/4 |

Reply with a number to resume, or provide a phase number to start new.
```

Wait for user response.

- If user replies with number (1, 2) → Load that file, go to `resume_from_file`
- If user replies with phase number → Treat as new session, go to `create_uat_file`

**If active sessions exist AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Check if session exists for that phase. If yes, offer to resume or restart.
If no, continue to `create_uat_file`.

**If no active sessions AND no $ARGUMENTS:**

```
No active UAT sessions.

Provide a phase number to start testing (e.g., /gsd:verify-work 4)
```

**If no active sessions AND $ARGUMENTS provided:**

Continue to `create_uat_file`.
</step>

<step name="find_summaries">
**Find what to test:**

Use `phase_dir` from init (or run init if not already done).

```bash
ls "$phase_dir"/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null
```

Read each SUMMARY.md to extract testable deliverables.
</step>

<step name="extract_tests">
**Extract testable deliverables from SUMMARY.md:**

Parse for:
1. **Accomplishments** - Features/functionality added
2. **User-facing changes** - UI, workflows, interactions

Focus on USER-OBSERVABLE outcomes, not implementation details.

For each deliverable, create a test:
- name: Brief test name
- expected: What the user should see/experience (specific, observable)

Examples:
- Accomplishment: "Added comment threading with infinite nesting"
  → Test: "Reply to a Comment"
  → Expected: "Clicking Reply opens inline composer below comment. Submitting shows reply nested under parent with visual indentation."

Skip internal/non-observable items (refactors, type changes, etc.).

**Cold-start smoke test injection:**

After extracting tests from SUMMARYs, scan the SUMMARY files for modified/created file paths. If ANY path matches these patterns:

`server.ts`, `server.js`, `app.ts`, `app.js`, `index.ts`, `index.js`, `main.ts`, `main.js`, `database/*`, `db/*`, `seed/*`, `seeds/*`, `migrations/*`, `startup*`, `docker-compose*`, `Dockerfile*`

Then **prepend** this test to the test list:

- name: "Cold Start Smoke Test"
- expected: "Kill any running server/service. Clear ephemeral state (temp DBs, caches, lock files). Start the application from scratch. Server boots without errors, any seed/migration completes, and a primary query (health check, homepage load, or basic API call) returns live data."

This catches bugs that only manifest on fresh start — race conditions in startup sequences, silent seed failures, missing environment setup — which pass against warm state but break in production.
</step>

<step name="create_uat_file">
**Create UAT file with all tests:**

```bash
mkdir -p "$PHASE_DIR"
```

Build test list from extracted deliverables.

Create file:

```markdown

<step name="present_all_tests">
**Present all tests to user as a batch checklist:**

Read Tests section from UAT file. Collect all pending tests.

Display using batch checklist format:

□ 1. {Test Name}

□ 3. {Test Name}

Wait for user response (plain text, no AskUserQuestion).
</step>

<step name="process_batch_response">
**Parse user's batch response and update file:**

**1. Parse the response for test results:**

- "all pass" / "all good" / "everything works" → mark ALL tests as pass
- Numbers with "pass" (e.g., "1,2,3 pass") → mark those as pass
- Numbers with failure description (e.g., "4 fails — error on submit") → mark as issues with severity inference
- Everything not explicitly marked as fail → assume pass

**2. For each test marked as pass:**

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: pass
```

**3. For each test marked as skip:**

- "skip", "can't test", "n/a" mentioned with a test number

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: skipped
reason: [user's reason if provided]
```

**4. For each test marked as issue:**

Infer severity from description:
- Contains: crash, error, exception, fails, broken, unusable → blocker
- Contains: doesn't work, wrong, missing, can't → major
- Contains: slow, weird, off, minor, small → minor
- Contains: color, font, spacing, alignment, visual → cosmetic
- Default if unclear: major

Update Tests section:
```
### {N}. {name}
expected: {expected}
result: issue
reported: "{verbatim user response for this test}"
severity: {inferred}
```

Append to Gaps section (structured YAML for plan-phase --gaps):
```yaml
- truth: "{expected behavior from test}"

  reason: "User reported: {verbatim user response for this test}"
  severity: {inferred}
  test: {N}
  artifacts: []  # Filled by diagnosis
  missing: []    # Filled by diagnosis
```

**5. After processing all results:**

Update Summary counts.
Update frontmatter.updated timestamp.
Write all updates to the UAT file at once.

If issues > 0 → Go to `complete_session`
If issues == 0 → Go to `complete_session`
</step>

<step name="resume_from_file">
**Resume testing from UAT file:**

Read the full UAT file.

Collect all tests with `result: [pending]`.
Collect all tests with results already recorded (pass/issue/skipped).

Announce:
```
Resuming: Phase {phase} UAT
Progress: {passed + issues + skipped}/{total}
Issues found so far: {issues count}

Present remaining tests as a batch checklist, showing which tests already passed:

Already completed:
  ✓ 1. {Test Name} — pass
  ✓ 2. {Test Name} — pass
  ✗ 3. {Test Name} — issue (logged)

Please test remaining items, then report results in ONE response.

□ 4. {Test Name}

Keep results in memory. Write to file only when:

| Frontmatter.updated | OVERWRITE | On any file write |

**Infer severity from user's natural language:**

| "doesn't work", "nothing happens", "wrong behavior" | major |
| "works but...", "slow", "weird", "minor issue" | minor |
| "color", "spacing", "alignment", "looks off" | cosmetic |

Default to **major** if unclear. User can correct if needed.

**Never ask "how severe is this?"** - just infer and move on.
