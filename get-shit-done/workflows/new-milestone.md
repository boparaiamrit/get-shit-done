<purpose>

Start a new milestone cycle for an existing project. Loads project context, proposes milestone scope using a recommendation-first approach (synthesizing from context, research, and conversation rather than interrogating), updates PROJECT.md and STATE.md, optionally runs parallel research, defines scoped requirements with REQ-IDs via a single proposal-and-approve cycle, spawns the roadmapper to create phased execution plan, and commits all artifacts. Brownfield equivalent of new-project.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

</required_reading>

<process>

## 1. Load Context

- Read PROJECT.md (existing project, validated requirements, decisions)
- Read MILESTONES.md (what shipped previously)
- Read STATE.md (pending todos, blockers)
- Check for MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md (from /gsd:discuss-milestone)

## 2. Gather Milestone Goals

**If MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md exists:**
- Use features and scope from discuss-milestone
- Present summary for confirmation

**If no context file:**
- Present what shipped in last milestone
- Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion): "What do you want to build next?"
- Wait for their response

**After receiving user input (from either path), generate a Milestone Proposal:**

Synthesize from the user's response, existing PROJECT.md, MILESTONES.md (what shipped, what was deferred), and STATE.md (pending items, accumulated context) to produce a proposal document:

```
# Milestone Proposal

## What I Understand
[Synthesize the user's stated goals with project history. Reference what shipped
in the last milestone and how this builds on it. Call out any deferred items from
previous milestones that are relevant.]

## Recommended Scope
### Decisions Made
- [Decision]: [Reason based on what shipped + project context]
- [Decision]: [Reason based on what shipped + project context]

### Recommendations
- [Topic]: Going with [X] because [reason]. Alt: [Y] if [condition].
- [Topic]: Going with [X] because [reason]. Alt: [Y] if [condition].

### Input Needed (max 3-5 items)
Only items where the project context genuinely does not provide enough
signal to make a recommendation. Each item still leads with a recommendation.

- [Question]: My recommendation: [X] because [reason].
- [Question]: My recommendation: [X] because [reason].

## Proposed Features
- [Feature 1] — [brief description, why it belongs in this milestone]
- [Feature 2] — [brief description, why it belongs in this milestone]
- [Feature 3] — [brief description, why it belongs in this milestone]

## Deferred (not this milestone)
- [Item] — [why it can wait]
```

Present the proposal inline, then use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Proposal"
- question: "Does this milestone scope look right?"
- options:
  - "Approve and proceed" — Scope is good, continue to versioning
  - "Override specific items" — I want to adjust some recommendations

**If "Override specific items":**
- Ask inline (freeform): "What would you like to change?"
- Incorporate feedback into the proposal
- Re-present the updated proposal with the same AskUserQuestion
- Loop until approved

## 3. Determine Milestone Version

- Parse last version from MILESTONES.md
- Suggest next version (v1.0 → v1.1, or v2.0 for major)
- Confirm with user

## 4. Update PROJECT.md

Add/update:

```markdown
## Current Milestone: v[X.Y] [Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence describing milestone focus]

**Target features:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
```

Update Active requirements section and "Last updated" footer.

## 5. Update STATE.md

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: [today] — Milestone v[X.Y] started
```

Keep Accumulated Context section from previous milestone.

## 6. Cleanup and Commit

Delete MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md if exists (consumed).

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: start milestone v[X.Y] [Name]" --files .planning/PROJECT.md .planning/STATE.md
```

## 7. Load Context and Resolve Models

```bash
INIT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init new-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Extract from init JSON: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `research_enabled`, `current_milestone`, `project_exists`, `roadmap_exists`.

## 8. Research Decision

Auto-decide based on milestone context. Default to "Research first" because new milestone features benefit from ecosystem discovery, then allow override.

Present the recommendation inline:

```
**Research recommendation:** Research first — new features ([list target features])
benefit from discovering current patterns, integration approaches, and common
pitfalls before defining requirements.
```

AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Research"
- question: "Research the domain ecosystem for new features before defining requirements?"
- options:
  - "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover patterns, features, architecture for NEW capabilities
  - "Skip research" — I know this domain well, go straight to requirements

**Persist choice to config** (so future `/gsd:plan-phase` honors it):

```bash
# If "Research first": persist true
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow.research true

# If "Skip research": persist false
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-set workflow.research false
```

**If "Research first":**

◆ Spawning 4 researchers in parallel...
  → Stack, Features, Architecture, Pitfalls
```

```bash
mkdir -p .planning/research
```

Spawn 4 parallel gsd-project-researcher agents. Each uses this template with dimension-specific fields:

**Common structure for all 4 researchers:**
```
Task(prompt="
<research_type>Project Research — {DIMENSION} for [new features].</research_type>

<milestone_context>
SUBSEQUENT MILESTONE — Adding [target features] to existing app.

```

**Dimension-specific fields:**

| Field | Stack | Features | Architecture | Pitfalls |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|----------|
| EXISTING_CONTEXT | Existing validated capabilities (DO NOT re-research): [from PROJECT.md] | Existing features (already built): [from PROJECT.md] | Existing architecture: [from PROJECT.md or codebase map] | Focus on common mistakes when ADDING these features to existing system |
| QUESTION | What stack additions/changes are needed for [new features]? | How do [target features] typically work? Expected behavior? | How do [target features] integrate with existing architecture? | Common mistakes when adding [target features] to [domain]? |
| CONSUMER | Specific libraries with versions for NEW capabilities, integration points, what NOT to add | Table stakes vs differentiators vs anti-features, complexity noted, dependencies on existing | Integration points, new components, data flow changes, suggested build order | Warning signs, prevention strategy, which phase should address it |
| GATES | Versions current (verify with Context7), rationale explains WHY, integration considered | Categories clear, complexity noted, dependencies identified | Integration points identified, new vs modified explicit, build order considers deps | Pitfalls specific to adding these features, integration pitfalls covered, prevention actionable |
| FILE | STACK.md | FEATURES.md | ARCHITECTURE.md | PITFALLS.md |

After all 4 complete, spawn synthesizer:

 GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Read PROJECT.md: core value, current milestone goals, validated requirements (what exists).

**If research exists:** Read FEATURES.md, extract feature categories.

**Generate a Requirements Proposal** by synthesizing from the approved milestone scope (Step 2), research findings (if available), PROJECT.md validated requirements, and MILESTONES.md history. Present the full proposal inline:

```
# Requirements Proposal for Milestone v[X.Y]

## Context
Building on [what exists] to add [milestone goal]. Based on [research findings
summary / conversation context].

## Proposed Requirements

### [Category 1]
**Table stakes** (users expect these):
- [ ] **CAT1-01**: User can [specific, testable action]
- [ ] **CAT1-02**: User can [specific, testable action]

**Differentiators** (competitive advantage):
- [ ] **CAT1-03**: User can [specific, testable action]

### [Category 2]
- [ ] **CAT2-01**: User can [specific, testable action]
- [ ] **CAT2-02**: User can [specific, testable action]

[... all categories ...]

## Deferred to Future Milestone
- [Feature] — [why it can wait: dependency on X, lower priority, etc.]

## Out of Scope
- [Feature] — [explicit reason for exclusion]

## Decisions Embedded
- [Decision]: [Rationale from milestone proposal + research]
```

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, NOTIF-02). Continue numbering from existing.

**Requirement quality criteria:**

Good requirements are:
- **Specific and testable:** "User can reset password via email link" (not "Handle password reset")
- **User-centric:** "User can X" (not "System does Y")
- **Atomic:** One capability per requirement (not "User can login and manage profile")
- **Independent:** Minimal dependencies on other requirements

**Single approval gate** via AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Requirements"
- question: "Does this capture what you're building?"
- options:
  - "Approve requirements" — Looks good, proceed to roadmap
  - "Adjust" — I want to change some requirements

**If "Adjust":**
- Ask inline (freeform): "What would you like to change? (add, remove, reword, recategorize)"
- Incorporate feedback into the requirements proposal
- Re-present the updated proposal with the same AskUserQuestion
- Loop until approved

**Commit requirements:**
```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: define milestone v[X.Y] requirements" --files .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
```
